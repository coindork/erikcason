Well. Finally got around to putting a website together for myself. I've had a bunch over the years, but never one just for myself.  I think I want to use this space just to do what I want. To share essays I've wrote that don't really belong anywhere, to share art that I've created because I like it, and to just share what my life is about. I'm not really sure why I feel a need to do that, like I am trying to find something in the world, but maybe through the process of just trying to sincerly share and not be looking for something in return I might find something for myself.
